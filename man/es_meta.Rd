\title{Effect size combination meta analysis.}
\usage{
es_meta(diff_exprs, cutoff = 0.3, by_source = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{diff_exprs}{Previous result of \code{\link{diff_expr}}, which can
be reloaded using \code{\link{load_diff}}.}

\item{cutoff}{Minimum fraction of contrasts that must have measured each gene.
Between 0 and 1.}

\item{by_source}{Should seperate meta-analyses be performed for each tissue
source added with \code{\link{add_sources}}?}
}
\value{
A list of named lists, one for each tissue source. Each list contains
   two named data.frames. The first, \code{filt}, has all the columns below for genes
   present in cutoff or more fraction of contrasts. The second, \code{raw}, has only
   \code{dprime} and \code{vardprime} columns, but for all genes (NAs for genes
   not measured by a given contrast).
   \item{dprime}{Unbiased effect sizes (one column per contrast).}
   \item{vardprime}{Variances of unbiased effect sizes (one column per contrast).}
   \item{mu}{Overall mean effect sizes.}
   \item{var}{Variances of overall mean effect sizes.}
   \item{z}{Overall z score = \code{mu / sqrt(var)}.}
   \item{fdr}{False discovery rates calculated from column \code{z} using fdrtool.}
   \item{pval}{p-values calculated from column \code{z} using fdrtool.}
}
\description{
Performs effect-size meta-analyses across all studies and seperately for
each tissue source.
}
\details{
Builds on \code{\link[GeneMeta]{zScores}} function from GeneMeta by allowing for genes
that were not measured in all studies. This implementation also uses moderated unbiased
effect sizes calculated by \code{\link[metaMA]{effectsize}} from metaMA and determines
false discovery rates using \code{\link[fdrtool]{fdrtool}}.
